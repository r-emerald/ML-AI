I have a good grasp on python programming language.
Using this I have worked on few ML models in MyCaptain Artificial Intelligence Workshop.

Currently I'm pursuing a course on Data Science for this semester in which we are taught the theorotical & coding aspects of ML models, optimisation techniques and their implementation from scratch.
